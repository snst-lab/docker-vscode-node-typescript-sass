# Try Out Development Containers: Node.js & TypeScript & Redis

This is a sample project that lets you try out the **[VS Code Remote - Containers](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/containers)** extension in a few easy steps.

> **Note:** If you're following the quick start, you can jump to the [Things to try](#things-to-try) section.

## Setting up the development container

Follow these steps to open this sample in a container:

1. If this is your first time using a development container, please follow the [getting started steps](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/containers/getting-started).

2. If you're not yet in a development container:
   - Clone this repository.
   ```sh
     git clone https://github.com/snst-lab/vscode-remote-try-node-typescript-redis
   ```
   - Run command below to launch container 
   ```sh
     docker-compose up --build
   ```
   - Press <kbd>F1</kbd> and select the **Remote-Containers: Attach to Running Container...** command.
   - Select the cloned copy of this folder, wait for the container to start, and try things out!

## Operation check of Redis
  After starting the container, you can check the operation of Redis with the following command.
  
   ```sh
    curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api
   ```
If it works properly, you have the following response.
   ```sh
    POST request received. Number of Visits: [Times of POST Request]
   ```

<br>

## Base Docker Image
  This tryout uses Minimum Ubuntu from the following repository 
> https://github.com/tianon/docker-brew-ubuntu-core/blob/59aa7dfef17153ecc812adbf26516675ce67e8aa/bionic/Dockerfile

There is 'alpine linux' as a representative of the small image.
But, I took an alternative since 'Remote Development' does not support 'alpine linux'.

## Things to try

One you have this sample opened in a container, you'll be able to work with it like you would locally.

Some things to try:

1. **Edit:**
   - Open `build/server/main.ts`
   - Try adding some code and check out the language features. Notice that `tslint` and the `eg2.tslint` extension are already installed in the container.
2. **Terminal:** Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>\`</kbd> and type `uname` and other Linux commands from the terminal window.
3. **Build, Run, and Debug:**
   - Build with command below 
   - Add a breakpoint (e.g. on line 20).
   - Press <kbd>F5</kbd> to launch the app in the container.
   - Once the breakpoint is hit, try hovering over variables, examining locals, and more.
   - Continue, then open a local browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` and note you can connect to the server in the container.
4. **Forward another port:**
   - Stop debugging and remove the breakpoint.
   - Open `server.js`
   - Change the server port to 5000. (`const PORT = 5000;`)
   - Press <kbd>F5</kbd> to launch the app in the container.
   - Press <kbd>F1</kbd> and run the **Remote-Containers: Forward Port from Container...** command.
   - Select port 5000.
   - Click "Open Browser" in the notification that appears to access the web app on this new port.

5. **Build with webpack**
   - After editing  `build/server/**.ts`, build it with command below using webpack. 
   ```sh
     webpack
   ```
   - Notice that if you have not done `npm install`, please execute first.
